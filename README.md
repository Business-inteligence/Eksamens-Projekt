# The Effect of deforestation.


During the fires in the Amazon rainforest in 2019, 9,060 km<sup>2</sup> of jungle was burned down in matter of months.

Even worse, the bushfires in Australia early 2020, burned down a wooping 186,000 km<sup>2</sup> of wild area.

In both of these instances, people was spreading their fustration all over social medias that "Earths lungs was burning up" and that the worlds politican was doing too little to stop it. 

Our large green ecosystems are often assosiated with producing earths oxygen, and many belive that places like the Amazon rainforrest produces more than 30% of the oxygen in earths atmoshphere that we breath on a daily basis to survive. 

It is belived that the Amazonas fire was started and kept alive due to massive amount of deforestation, done by big companies and the government to increase their production and urbanization of the exposed land.


## However...
Some research seem to indicate, that the Amazon Rainforrest, while producing a lot of oxygen, reuses most, if not all, the oxygen it produces, to keep itself alive. 

So I have decided to gather some data, about defoestation, urbanization, population growth, money spend on envionmental/alternative energy research and the cleanliness of the air. To try and put som data to the claim. And to see if we as Human should worry about the damage we do our planet. Maybe technologies and money really is the right way to fix our problem. Or maybe leaving the forrests alone, is the more effective way. 


# The questions then becomes...

- Will deforestation increase air polution in the imidiate area.

- will urbanization increase air polution in the imidiate area.

- Will increasing the budget for green-tech companies and research reduce air polution.

- Will people in an area have effect on polution.

- When will we reach our breaking point for air polution (When will we run out of Oxygen)

- Is funding research worth the finacial cost VS being more mindfull.


## My hyptheses before my findings:

I am a firm believer in sience. And most sience suggest that we are on a sippery slope when it comes to earths healt and its ecosystmes. I strongly believe that the best way to fight global conesquenses is to be more mindfull of our green areas. But i also believe that we could balance a lot of it out with technologies. 

I expect my findings to back up this claim. That more people, more urbanization and more deforestation will result in a more poluted air. But as we see funding for research go up, we will see a small dip in the air polution. 


# ---------------STAGE 2-------------------
In Stage two I added a small story for the data, with a few images and graphs showing the evolution of the population in EU since, 1950 till 2020 and the evolution of CO2pmm in the same period. To see if there could be any sort of corrolation. 

My findings using the graphs shows that, during the boom in the 50's and 90's the population grew greatly. When we look closer at the two grahps we can see the soft curve of both follwoing each other in synch. 

The interresting information to gain from these graphs is, how the population slowly flatlines but the CO2pmm keeps its slope coefficient.

# ---------------STAGE 3-------------------

# Machine Learning

On stage 3 I wanted to add a small prediction model for the story. On the final page of the story, I have added a small input field, that accepts a "Year" parameter. It is connected to a notebook python project through tapby (running in an anaconda terminal).
all connected methods can be seen on localhost:9004.

When entering a Year, the field below will return the anwser with the expected CO2ppm for that year. 


Ex. Year 2050 will have CO2ppm of ~449ppm

The python code is available in the "Linear Calculation of CO2.ipynb" file.
